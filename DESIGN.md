## Workflows

### Initial User Registration

The user must register with the Station Manager online service before they can access any online service. The registration
process is as follows:

1. User enters their *username*, *email address*, and a *password*.
2. Station Manager sends an email to the user with a link to confirm their email address.
3. User clicks the link in the email to confirm their email address.
4. When the user confirms their email address, their account is activated, and they can log in to the Station Manager online service.

### Logbook Creation

To create a new logbook, the user must first register with the Station Manager online service. A 
user creates a new logbook via the web interface or via the desktop application.
